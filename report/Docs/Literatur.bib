 abstract = {Given a set of N cities, with every two linked by a road, and the times required to traverse these roads, we wish to determine the path from one given city to another given city which minimizes the travel time. The times are not directly proportional to the distances due to varying quality of roads and varying quantities of traffic. The functional equation technique of dynamic programming, combined with approximation in policy space, yields an iterative algorithm which converges after at most (N --- 1) iterations.},

Written by a leading developer of such policies, it presents a series of methods, uniqueness and existence theorems, and examples for solving the relevant equations. The text examines existence and uniqueness theorems, the optimal inventory equation, bottleneck problems in multistage production processes, a new formalism in the calculus of variation, strategies behind multistage games, and Markovian decision processes.

 abstract = {We investigate the possibility of applying the Dynamic Programming (DP) algorithm to obtain an optimal solution for a class of multistage decision problems under uncertainty. This class corresponds to the discrete time control problems, where the uncertainty is due to disturbances in the evolution of the state process. The disturbances are assumed to belong to random sets, which is related to the so-called Mathematical Theory of Hints.},
