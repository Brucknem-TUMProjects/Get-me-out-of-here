 abstract = {Given a set of N cities, with every two linked by a road, and the times required to traverse these roads, we wish to determine the path from one given city to another given city which minimizes the travel time. The times are not directly proportional to the distances due to varying quality of roads and varying quantities of traffic. The functional equation technique of dynamic programming, combined with approximation in policy space, yields an iterative algorithm which converges after at most (N â€” 1) iterations.},
